                <p center>Anything not listed in the rules is generally okay, however common sense should still be used. If you have any questions, ask a moderator. These rules may change, and if they do, an announcement will be posted in this server.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Using cheat clients</li>
                        <li>Using a resource pack to see through blocks that would normally be fully opaque (xray)</li>

                <p center><b>These rules are loosely defined and should be up to people to decide how they want to follow them in specific scenarios. For example, during a war, griefing and stealing is up to the people who are in the war.</b></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't start a conflict with someone who isn't trying to be in a conflict.</li>
                        <li>Don't try to grief other people's areas. If an explosion happens by accident, try to patch it up or notify them. Messing with other people's bases in ways that don't destroy much property and are just for fun is okay.</li>
                        <li>Don't take items from people unless they give you permission. If it is a small amount of a non-valuable item, taking it is fine, as long as you notify them and give the item back if they ask.</li>
                        <li>Don't steal from farms, even if you were loading that farm. Only use farms that aren't yours in ways that you have been given permission for.</li>
                        <li>Don't kill people if they don't want you to.</li>
